A simple, powerful and easy-to-use plugin that will help you to manage multilingual content in a multisite WordPress installation.

== Description ==

A simple, powerful, and user-friendly plugin that adds multilingual support to your [WordPress multisite](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/create-a-network/) installation, whether using multiple subdomains or folders. Multisite Language Switcher allows you to effortlessly manage translations for posts, pages, custom post types, categories, tags, and custom taxonomies.

The plugin uses flag icons from [FamFamFam](http://famfamfam.com). Thanks to Mark James for his great work. In addition, I would like to thank [Jürgen Mayer](https://creativpin.com) for creating the plugin's banner.

Please, don't forget to [rate this plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/multisite-language-switcher/reviews/)! :-)

== Installation ==

* Use the WordPress admin to install the plugin from there or
* Download the plugin and uncompress it with your preferred unzip programme and copy the entire directory in the plugin directory of your WordPress blog (/wp-content/plugins)
* Activate the plugin in your plugin administration page (by the network administrator on all the blogs or by the blog administrator for each particular blog).
* You need to activate the plugin once in each blog, by setting the configuration in `Settings` -> `Multisite Language Switcher`

Now you can:

* Connect your translated pages and posts in `Posts` -> `Edit` or `Page` -> `Edit`
* Connect your translated categories and tags in `Posts` -> `Categories` or `Post` -> `Tags`
* connect your Custom Post Types and Custom Taxonomies across languages
* use the widget, the Gutenberg block, the shortcode [sc_msls] and/or a content_filter which displays a hint to the user if a translation is available
* you can find also a shortcode for the widget [sc_msls_widget]
* optionally you can place the code `<?php if ( function_exists( 'the_msls' ) ) the_msls(); ?>` directly in your theme files

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have no language options in the General settings. =

You might read first [WordPress in your language](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language).

= But I'd like the interface to stay in English. =

You can choose the language of the dashboard in the settings of your user profile.

= Do I need a multisite? =

It's up to you - of course. But yes, if you want to use the Multisite Language Switcher.

= How can I automatically redirect users based on the browser language? =

The Multisite Language Switcher does not redirect the users automatically. I'm not sure if the plugin should do that. You might check out this [jQuery plugin](
https://github.com/danieledesantis/jquery-language-detection) or [this approach with a theme](https://github.com/oncleben31/Multisite-Language-Switcher-Theme)
if you need such functionality.

= How can I add the Multisite Language Switcher to the nav menu of my blog? =

Please check the add-on [MslsMenu](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mslsmenu/) out.

= I want to have the languages in an HTML select. How can I do that? =

Please check the add-on [MslsSelect](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mslsselect/) out.

= Can I call a function to get the language of the page the user is viewing? =

Yes, you should use the WordPress API function `get_locale()` but you could also use code like that

`use lloc\Msls\MslsBlogCollection;

$blog     = MslsBlogCollection::instance()->get_current_blog();
$language = $blog->get_language();`

= If I have another question, where can I ask? =

Please visit the [MSLS website](https://msls.co/) or use the [WordPress support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/multisite-language-switcher) for more information.
